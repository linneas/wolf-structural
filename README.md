All code is written by Linn√©a Smeds and Lars S.A. Huson, except the scripts `gen_samplot_*.py` that were generously provided by Gabriel David (David et al. (2024). *Genome Biology and Evolution*, 16(4) evae049, [https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae049](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae049)).

All parts of the project are described in the script `main_commands.sh`.  
R scripts for creating the figures in the paper are found in the subdirectory `R/`.

The raw structural variant ouput from Smoove, as well as final filtered and curated genotype data and sample metadata are found in **Dryad**: [10.5061/dryad.12jm63z57](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.12jm63z57).
